  <p>
    When a build is scheduled, it will attempt to lock the specified resources. If
    some (or all) the resources are already locked by another build, the build will
    be queued until they are released.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only one of the Resources, Label or Groovy Expression fields may be specified.
    <br>
    The resource name, label and number can also be specified as coming from a
    build parameter (<code>${<em>parameterName</em>}</code>).
