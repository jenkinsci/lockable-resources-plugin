        A list of axis names separated by whitespace to ignore when generating
        dynamic resources configurations.
    <p>
        When generating configurations for dynamic resources, the matrix configuration is
        used - each axis in the configuration is considered a distinct identifier. If any of
        these identifiers are to be ignored, the axis name should be specified here.
    <p>
        For example, if the job creating resources should be limited to run on a single node,
        a 'Slaves' type axis named 'nLabel' might be introduced in the matrix configuration to limit where
        it can run. As the other jobs are not limited to run on any node, the 'nLabel' axis would
        cause an incompatibility in configurations; because of this, 'nLabel' should be specified as an
        axis to be ignored.
    <p style="color:red">
        Names that contain whitespace will be considered two or more separate names. Please do not
        use whitespace when defining axis names.
