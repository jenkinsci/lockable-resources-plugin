    <p>
        If checked, each matrix configuration in this project will consume at least one
        resource created by other jobs. The dynamic resource's configuration is based on the matrix
        configuration currently running (ignoring the axis marked as such), 
        the value of a token, the name of this job and the names of the jobs dynamic resources
        are generated by.
    <p>
        The number of resources consumed is equal to the number of job names specified; one resource
        is required from each job.
    <p style="color:red"><b>
            The configuration for the dynamic resources created has to be identical to that of the
            dynamic resources consumed. If any parameter in the configuration does not match,
            the resources created will not be acknowledged as consumable by the other jobs.</b>
