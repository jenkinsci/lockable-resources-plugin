<div>
    <p>
        A list of job names separated by whitespace. The names in the list will be used when
        requesting resources (if the 'Consume dynamic resources from other builds' option is checked).
    <p>
        One resource will be consumed for each name in the list, based on the matrix configuration
        currently running (ignoring axis marked as such), the injected parameter, and the name
        of a job (in the list).
    <p style="color:red">
        Names that contain whitespace will be considered two or more separate names. Please do not
        use whitespace when defining job names.
