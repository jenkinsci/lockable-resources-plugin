<div>
	<p>
		A list of job names separated by whitespace. The names in the list will be used when
		generated resources (if the 'Create dynamic resources for other builds' option is checked).
	<p>
		One resource will be created for each name in the list, based on the matrix configuration
		currently running (ignoring axis marked as such), the injected parameter, and the name
		of a job (in the list).
	<p style="color:red">
		Names that contain whitespace will be considered two or more separate names. Please do not
		use whitespace when defining job names.
