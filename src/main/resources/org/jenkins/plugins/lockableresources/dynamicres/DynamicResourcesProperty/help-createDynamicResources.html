        If checked, each matrix configuration in this project will generate one or more dynamic
        resources for other jobs. The dynamic resources' configuration is based on the matrix
        configuration currently running (ignoring the axis marked as such), 
        the value of a token, the name of this job and the names of the jobs dynamic resources
        are generated for.
    <p>
        The number of resources created is equal to the number of job names specified; one resource
        is created for each job.
    <p style="color:red"><b>
            The configuration for the dynamic resources created has to be identical to that of the
            dynamic resources consumed. If any parameter in the configuration does not match,
            the resources created will not be acknowledged as consumable by the other jobs.</b>
