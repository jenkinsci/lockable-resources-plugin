		If checked, each matrix configuration in this project will generate one or more dynamic
		resources for other jobs. The dynamic resources' configuration is based on the matrix
		configuration currently running (ignoring the axis marked as such), 
		the injected parameter, and the names of the jobs dynamic resources are generated for.
	<p>
		The number of resources created is equal to the number of job names specified; one resource
		is created for each job.
	<p style="color:red"><b>
		The configuration for the dynamic resources created has to be identical to that of the
		dynamic resources consumed. If any parameter in the configuration does not match,
		the resources created will not be acknowledged as consumable by the other jobs.</b>
