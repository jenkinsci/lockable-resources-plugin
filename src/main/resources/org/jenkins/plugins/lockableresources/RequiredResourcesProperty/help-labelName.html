<div>
<p>
If you have created a pool of resources, i.e. a label, you can take it into use
here. The build will select the resource(s) from the pool that includes all
resources sharing the given label.
Either Label or Resources field must be empty.
</p>
<p>
If label starts with groovy: then it is treated as a groovy expression to be
evaluated each time a resource is checked to be appropriate for a build. The
expression must result into a boolean value. The following variables are available:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>resourceName - as per resource configuration</li>
    <li>resourceDescription - as per resource configuration</li>
    <li>resourceLabels - java.util.List&lt;String&gt; of labels as per resource configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>
For matrix jobs, axis names and axis values are referencable as well. Examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>groovy:resourceLabels.contains("hardcoded")</li>
    <li>groovy:resourceLabels.contains(axisName)</li>
    <li>groovy:resourceName == axisName</li>
</ul>
</div>
