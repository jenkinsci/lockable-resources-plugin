<p>
When a build is scheduled, it will attempt to lock the specified resources. If
some (or all) the resources are already locked by another build, the build will
be queued until they are released. If the option for only one resource is
selected below, one of the given resources will be tried to be locked.
</p>
<p>
By default, all builds have the same lock priority (defined in the global
configuration). If you want a specific job to have a different priority, you
need to add a parameter to the job. The priority must be an integer (lowest
priority will start first). The parameter name is also defined in the global
configuration (<code>LOCK_PRIORITY</code> by default).
