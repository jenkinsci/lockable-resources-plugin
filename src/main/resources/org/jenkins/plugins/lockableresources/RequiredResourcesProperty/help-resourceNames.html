<p>
When a build is scheduled, it will attempt to lock the specified resources. If
some (or all) the resources are already locked by another build, the build will
be queued until they are released. It is possible to specify an amount for
requested resources below.
</p>
<p>
One or more space-separated resources names can be defined.

You can also use parameters expansion.
For ex. if both parameters 'MY_RESOURCE_1' and 'MY_RESOURCE_2' are defined, use '${MY_RESOURCE_1} ${MY_RESOURCE_2}'.
