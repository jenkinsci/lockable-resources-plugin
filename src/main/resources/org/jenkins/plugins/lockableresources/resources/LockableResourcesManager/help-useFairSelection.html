        If this option is selected, the plugin will use an internal algorithm to select
        the free resources based on their capabilities.<br/>
        The resource that has a unique capability among all other resources has less chance
        to be selected.<br />
        On the contrary, if a free resource has very common capabilities it will probably be selected

        This option is highly experimental.
