Any contributions are welcome.

This repository contains lockable-resources [plugin](/plugin/) and  [shared-library](/shared-library/README.md).

The [plugin](/plugin/) is the core part. Contains all the Java, Jelly, CSS, localizations ... for the plugin self.

The [shared-library](/shared-library/README.md) is an extension to the plugin self with many solutions and interfaces done in Groovy.
