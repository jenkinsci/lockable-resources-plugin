## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this plugin, you probably will need a Jenkins plugin development
environment. This basically means a current version of Java (Java 11 should probably be okay for now)
and [Apache Maven]. See the [Jenkins Plugin Tutorial] for details.

If you have the proper environment, typing:

```
    mvn verify
```

should create a plugin as `target/*.hpi`, which you can install in your Jenkins instance. Running

```
    mvn hpi:run -Djenkins.version=2.361.1
```

allows you to spin up a test Jenkins instance on [localhost] to test your
local changes before committing.

### Code Style

This plugin tries to migrate to [Google Java Code Style], please try to adhere to that style
whenever adding new files or making big changes to existing files. If your IDE doesn't support
this style, you can use the [fmt-maven-plugin], like this:

```
    mvn fmt:format -DfilesNamePattern=ChangedFile\.java
```

to reformat Java code in the proper style.

## Code coverage

Test coverage is a percentage measure of the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a test is run. A program with high test coverage has more of its source code executed during testing, which suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage. The best way to improve code coverage is writing of automated tests.

To get local liny-by-line coverage report execute this command

```
    mvn -Djenkins.version=2.361.1 -P enable-jacoco clean verify jacoco:report
```

The report is then located in *target/site/jacoco/index.html*.
